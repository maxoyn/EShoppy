# EShoppy
An simple Android application for tracking shopping lists targeted at families. </br>
It’s using Google’s Firebase API for storing, updating and synchronizing the created lists and users. </br>
There are also private lists, stored locally which do not require an account.</br>
In order to view the same synchronized lists, users need to share a single account. </br>
This is the main point – the simplicity of not having to share a list every time with another account and not having a mini social network within the app.</br>
</br>
The core functionality is operational, but the UI is incomplete.</br>

You can just install the APK.  It's located in the apk folder.</br>
